It is meant to be a light-weight implementation of a\r\ngraph database on mobile devices. The port removes HBase and Cassandra support\r\nas their usage make little sense on a mobile device (convince me otherwise!).\r\nGremlin is only supported via the Java interface as I have not been able to \r\nport groovy successfully. Nevertheless, Titan-Android supports local storage \r\nbackend via BerkeleyDB and supports the [Tinkerpop](http://tinkerpop.com/) \r\nstack natively.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncluding in Your Project\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to include the library in your projects:\r\n\r\n1. You can download the released jar file in the [Downloads section](https://github.com/wuman/titan-android/downloads).\r\n2. If you use Maven to build your project you can simply add a dependency to \r\n   the desired component of the library.\r\n\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>com.wu-man</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>titan-android</artifactId>\r\n            <version>0.1.0.0</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Titan\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nTitan is a highly scalable [graph database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database) \r\noptimized for storing and querying large graphs with billions of vertices and \r\nedges distributed across a multi-machine cluster. Titan is a transactional \r\ndatabase that can support \r\n[thousands of concurrent users](http://thinkaurelius.com/2012/08/06/titan-provides-real-time-big-graph-data/).\r\n\r\nTitan has the following features:\r\n\r\n* Elastic and linear scalability for a growing data and user base.\r\n* Data distribution and replication for performance and fault tolerance.\r\n* Support for [ACID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) and \r\n  [eventual consistency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency).\r\n* Support for various [storage backend](https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan/wiki/Storage-Backend-Overview):\r\n    * [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org)\r\n    * [Apache HBase](http://hbase.apache.org)\r\n    * [Oracle BerkeleyDB](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/overview/index-093405.html)\r\n* Native integration with the [TinkerPop](http://www.tinkerpop.com) graph stack:\r\n    * [Gremlin](http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com) graph query language\r\n    * [Frames](http://frames.tinkerpop.com) object-to-graph mapper\r\n    * [Rexster](http://rexster.tinkerpop.com) REST graph server\r\n    * [Blueprints](http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com) standard graph API\r\n\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking \r\nthe repository and sending a pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloped By\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* Android porting contributor\r\n    * David Wu - <david@wu-man.com> - [http://blog.wu-man.com](http://blog.wu-man.com)\r\n* Original contributors to Titan\r\n    * Marko A.
